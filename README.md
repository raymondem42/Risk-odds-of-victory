# Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the odds of victory for the attackers in the board game Risk, by simulating dice rolls. The simulations are based on the standard Risk dice rules, and the results are generated by simulating 1,000,000 scenarios for each combination of attackers and defenders. The output is then stored in the output.txt file.

## Motivation
So this project came out os frustration of somehow finding the most creative ways to lose at the board game risk. So the other day after losing so many attacks when I had a dramatic advantage the (I may or may not have still been playing the game while making this code), I made this program to simulate the risk dice rolls.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run it and observe the results in the output.txt file. The program simulates dice rolls for different attacker and defender combinations, presenting the percentage of victories for the attackers.

## Sample Results
Here are some sample results from the simulations:

With 10 attacking dice against 11 defending dice, the attackers win 49.4803% of the time.

With 5 attacking dice against 7 defending dice, the attackers win 29.7291% of the time.

With 2 attacking dice against 4 defending dice, the attackers win 9.1269% of the time.

## Interesting takeaways
1. Thresholds for Overwhelming Success:
Notice a significant jump in attacker win rates when the number of attacking dice surpasses the number of defending dice. For instance, with 6 attacking dice against 5 defending dice, the attackers win 63.75% of the time, but with 7 attacking dice against 5 defending dice, the win rate skyrockets to 73.71%. This suggests that achieving a certain threshold of attacking dice relative to defenders dramatically increases the odds of success.

2. Strategic Advantage of Balanced Forces:
In situations with an equal number of attacking and defending dice, the attackers surprisingly win a substantial percentage of the time. For example, with 5 attacking dice against 5 defending dice, the attackers win 50.58% of the time. This challenges the conventional belief that balanced forces lead to a stalemate, indicating a strategic advantage for the attackers in such scenarios.

3. Diminishing Returns with Overwhelming Force:
Interestingly, as the number of attacking dice continues to increase against a fixed number of defending dice, the rate of increase in the win percentage diminishes. The difference in win rates between 9 attacking dice and 10 attacking dice, in many cases, is less significant than the difference between 2 attacking dice and 3 attacking dice. This implies that pouring additional forces may not always yield proportional increases in success rates.

4. Resilience of Defenders:
Surprisingly, defenders maintain a non-zero chance of winning even when the odds seem overwhelmingly against them. In scenarios like 1 attacking die against 5 defending dice, defenders win approximately 0.18% of the time. This showcases the unpredictability and resilience of defending forces, adding an element of risk and excitement to the game.

6. Critical Defensive Mass:
Explore scenarios where the defenders achieve a critical mass, leading to a sudden drop in attacker win rates. For instance, with 10 attacking dice against 10 defending dice, the attackers win 56.62% of the time. However, with 11 attacking dice against 10 defending dice, the attackers win 62.67% of the time. This unexpected reversal suggests that reaching a certain number of defending dice can disproportionately enhance defensive capabilities.
